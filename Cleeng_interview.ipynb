    "As far as further analysis of the datasets, I had the idea to compare the purchasing habits of various demographics and nationalities between to see which specific product different groups favour. I also think it would be extremely interesting to take a look at whether being from a certain country or region has either a larger or smaller impact on the probability that an individual purchases something compared to which demographic they belong to. Finding out which factor (or unique combination of factors) really make a difference on the probability that something occurs or not is a very fascinating concept to me and one of the things that really led me to data science and data analysis in the first place. Beyond this, I really think that this dataset could serve well as an amazing training dataset for use in machine learning, specifically for a predictive customer purchasing algorithm."

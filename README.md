# Physics, Math & Statistics

The vast majority of projects you'll find here are mathematical and computational physics based research. Please feel free to take a look and help yourself to anything that is of use. All of these projects should be rather self explanatory, with the topics convered including Mn-54 isotropic decay, milky way mass determination and eigenval approximation for the Legendre equation. These problems have been tackled with a variety of different statistical and computational techniques, including Monte Carlo simulation, non-linear optimization, and matrix calculus.

Example: Visualizing the First 10 Legendre Polynomials

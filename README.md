Hello! 

  Welcome to my Git and my Data Science/Physics/Math/Stats Repository! It's a little barebones at the moment but hopefully it'll be up and running before long. Just as a little bit of background about me I graduated from Queen's University in 2019 with a Bachelor's of Science in both Physics and Mathematics. My interests lie in game theory, machine learning and superconductor physics and I hope to break into the data science sector.

  The vast majority of what you'll find here is mathematical/computational physics stuff that I have done in the past in python. Please feel free to take a look and help yourself to anything that is of use to you. The vast majority of it is rather self explanatory with most of my past projects concerning derivative approximation, statistical analysis and data visualization by and large for physics and math based projects.

  My background in code is largely working with Python and I am working hard at learning SQL, so expect to see at least one of those languages for the vast majority of all my projects here. 

  At the moment, I'm currently working towards improving my proficiency using SQL and scikit to better my understanding of machine learning and hopefully make me a better data scientist in the process. I intend to create more and projects of this nature as I continue to grow and learn.

  I'm always looking for inspiration so if you think you have a project I could help contribute to please let me know!

Cheers,

Brandon

Hello! 

Welcome to my Physics/Math/Stats Repository! 

The vast majority of projects you'll find here are mathematical and computational physics based research. Please feel free to take a look and help yourself to anything that is of use. All of these projects should be rather self explanatory with topics such as Isotropic decay prediction, milky way gravity optimization and Legendre Polynomial determination tackled with a variety of statistical and mathematical techniques including Monte Carlo modelling, statistical computing, etc.

Best.

Hello! Welcome to my Git! It's a little barebones at the moment but hopefully it'll be up and running before long. Just as a little bit
of background about me I graduated from Queen's University in 2019 with a degree in physics and mathematics. I am particulary
interested in game theory, superconductor physics and hope to break into the global markets space working with big data.

The vast majority of what you'll find here is mathematical/computational physics stuff from my undergrad done in python, feel free to take a look and help yourself to my code. The vast majority of it is rather self explanatory mostly concering derivative approximation, linear algebra and statiscial analysis and data presentation for several physics based projects.

My background in code is largely working with Python, Matlab and SQL so expect to see atleast one of those three for all of my projects here.
I'm always looking for inspiration so if you think you have a project I could help contribute to please let me know!

Cheers!

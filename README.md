# Physics, Math & Statistics

The vast majority of projects you'll find here are mathematical and computational physics based research. Please feel free to take a look and help yourself to anything that is of use. All of these projects should be rather self explanatory, with topics such as Mn-54 isotropic decay, milky way mass determination and eigenval approximation for the Legendre equation tackled with a variety of different statistical and mathematical techniques. Expect to see methods such as Monte Carlo simulation, non-linear optimization, and multivariate matrix calculus covered.
